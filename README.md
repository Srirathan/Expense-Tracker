# Expense Tracker

## Overview
The Expense Tracker is a web application designed to help users manage their finances by tracking income and expenses. The app allows users to input transactions, view them in a table, filter them by type (income or expense), and monitor their overall balance. Additionally, it provides a feature to delete all transactions at once, and it saves data in local storage so that transactions persist across page reloads.

## Features
- Add transactions with a description, amount, category, and type (income/expense).
- Filter transactions to show all, only income, or only expenses.
- View the current balance, dynamically updated based on the transactions.
- Delete individual transactions or clear all transactions at once.
- Persistent data storage using the browser's local storage.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop views.
